How to Play
-----------

There are two players, an attacker and a defender.

When play starts the defender gets to place a number of pieces on the board. They must place their Central Core 
at this point. Other pieces are optional. Each piece has a cost. The defender can place as many as they have 
the resources (rez) for. The defender must also place at least one entry point.

The attacker then gets to play. They must first spawn a piece at an entry point and move it. In future turns the 
attacker may move an existing piece or spawn a new piece and move it.

The defender and attacker alternate goes from now on. The defender may choose not to move on his go.
